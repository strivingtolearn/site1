# Don't forget the layout!

This is what it looks like when the ***layout*** attribute is not defined or
points to a non-existent layout file.

***layout*** can be set in a [configuration
file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) (generally `_config.yml`) or in
a YAML block referred to as [Front
Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) in individual pages.

'single' and "double" quotes may even be broken depending on your browser, its
settings, or the smart quote settings for your chosen markdown engine.

Inside a codeblock, "quotes" and 'quotes' seem to work just fine, though.

## Configuration Examples

#### _config.yml

{% highlight yaml %}
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "default"
<...>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Front Matter
